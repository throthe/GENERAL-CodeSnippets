   Question: TestDome - TreeHeight
   By Arash Partow 2014

   A tree is an abstract data structure consisting of nodes. Each node
   has only one parent node and zero or more child nodes. Each tree has
   one special node, called a root, which has no parent node. A node is
   called a leaf if it has no child nodes. The height of a tree is the
   largest distance (number of parent-child connections) from the root to
   a leaf.

   Write a function that calculates the height of a given tree. For
   example, the tree below has a height of 2 since the longest distance
   (number of parent-child connections) from the root to a leaf is 2 (the
   connections are the root to a node and then the node to leaf 1):
